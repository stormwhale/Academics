Later, the system went through many more layers of refinement such as monitoring the watch time, or adding classification to filter out borderline-content from being recommended.\n",

Perhaps, a little bit more randomness into the recommender system will create more flavors in content discoveries.\n"

    "As recommender systems are susceptible to coordinated attacks, there are already some defensive measures that i have seen being implemented by big companies such as Amazon. For example, these techniques are verified purchase reviews, reviews/rating has a time-delay between purchase to when reviews can become available to enter, or classification system to filter and flag accounts that leave reviews that are too brief or short. I would imagine a weighted system to calculate the importance of reviews/ratings can also be implemented to see whether certain malicious reviews can be counted towards the final rating score."
